1. What design choices did you make (colors, fonts, layout)?
- I chose a clean and simple design with a white background, maroon buttons, and black text to create a simple look. The maroon color highlights important elements like the “Edit” button and the “My Profile” header, while the white background keeps the layout bright and readable. I used consistent spacing and alignment to make the layout organized and visually balanced.
  
3. How did you ensure the screen is user-friendly and accessible?

- I made sure the text was clear and readable by using good contrast between the text and background. Buttons were designed with enough size and color contrast for easy tapping. The layout is simple and intuitive, so users can easily see their profile information and quickly find the “Edit” option.

5. What would you improve if this were a real app?

- If this were a real app, I would add interactive features like editing and saving profile details, uploading a new profile picture, and responsive design for different devices. I would also consider adding accessibility options such as larger text settings.
